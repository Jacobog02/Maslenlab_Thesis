## Environment Setup

To install the required conda environment to perform read alignment please run `bash env/conda_env_setup` ensuring the code to create the env is uncommented. This operation could be automated in the future. 
To source the env to export to exacloud nodes, please `source env/conda_env_setup` to activate it. 

## Read Alignment

Please see dir `mcseq_data` for the alignment pipeline.
